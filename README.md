Hello, fellow programmer!

This is a README.md file for my project: "Quiz Sort Program"

The purpose of the project: To sort quizes based on how many questions they have, starting from the least amount of questions to the most

Why is this useful?: Imagine yourself as a student with 11 quizes, all with varying number of questions. You want to do them from the least amount of questions to the most.
                     Ordering them manually would take time. This program provides a solution to that problem. You simply to input the title of the quiz and the number of quizes it has.
                     It will output a list of quizes, starting from the least amount of questions to the most amount of questions.

A few facts about this program: 1. This program runs in O(nlog(n)) time because of the sorting phase (the ordering phase runs in O(n) time).

Thank you for reading and I hope you found this to be helpful!
